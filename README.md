# AspectRecipes

AspectRecipes adds crafting recipes for elite aspect equipment in Risk of Rain 2, as well as fleshed out logbook entries for all the aspects..

2 unused aspects in the game code have been given recipes.

The old recipes which were removed in a recent update (His Spiteful Boon, Aurelionite's Blessing, His Reassurance) have been added back, with the same recipes that they had.

Considerations have been made regarding thematic/gameplay cohesion, as well as balancing (more powerful aspects will require more powerful/rare items).
